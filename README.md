These files are publicly available scripts for the BoX Rush project. It is a mobile game app developed for the android platform.
The scripts are coded with C# and made to take up a few lines of code.
Some of the scripts are for my own personal projects, but I also used them for this project.
The descriptions are concise so for more detailed descriptions and explanations, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
